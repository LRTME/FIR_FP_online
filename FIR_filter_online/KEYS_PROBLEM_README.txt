If you are having troubles with keyboard in Code Composer Studio (some charachters on keyboard can't type in), 
is worth checking shortcuts. The problem migth be causing "Alt Gr", which means "Ctrl + Alt", too. 


To check shortcuts in Code Composer Studio, do next:

1. Click on "Window" and then "Preferences",
2. Click on tab "General" and then "Keys" (somewhere in the middle),
3. Scheme is set to "Default",
4. If "{"" is not working ("Alt Gr" + "B"), type in search filter this: "+b" 
5. All shortcuts whit b should be visible now,
6. Clear all shortcuts ("Bindings"), that are containing "Ctrl + Alt",
7. Try if problem is solved and "{" works again.
